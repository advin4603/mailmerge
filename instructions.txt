Mail Merge uses Template files to perform word substitutions.

A template file must be made according to the following rules:
	-> A variable may be used to indicate where a word must be substituted or not
	-> A variable name may be declared by enclosing a variable name in Angular Brackets <> .
	-> A variable name must only contain alphanumeric characters(a-z, A-Z, 0-9) or _ and must span across a single line.

Mail Merge first asks for the template file.

Then it asks whether you want to use data from a MySQL Table.
If not then it will ask you to fill up data in a .csv file.

After filling the data in the .csv file, Mail Merge will ask you if you want to save the data in a MySQL Table.

Mail Merge will substitute the values given in the data in place of variable names used in the template file.

Mail Merge will ask for save location.  

The output will be saved in the provided output file. 

NOTE: Usage of MySQL databases requires an installation of MySQL running in localhost.
